## Development Environment Setup

This project uses a deterministic dependency management system to ensure consistent, repeatable builds across all environments. Adherence to this process is mandatory.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.11+
*   `pip` and `venv` (included with standard Python installations)

### 1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

It is critical to work within a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# On macOS / Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Tooling

Install the `pip-tools` package, which is used to compile the dependency lockfile.

```bash
pip install pip-tools
```

### 3. Managing Dependencies

Project dependencies are managed via two files:
*   `requirements.in`: A high-level list of direct dependencies. **This is the only file you should manually edit.**
*   `requirements.txt`: A machine-generated lockfile with pinned, transitive dependencies. **Do not edit this file by hand.**

After modifying `requirements.in`, you must regenerate the `requirements.txt` lockfile using the appropriate command for your operating system.

**Windows (PowerShell):**
It is critical to specify UTF-8 encoding, as PowerShell's default redirection (`>`) uses an encoding incompatible with Linux-based Docker images.

```powershell
pip-compile requirements.in | Out-File -FilePath requirements.txt -Encoding utf8
```

**macOS / Linux (bash, zsh, etc.):**
Standard shell redirection works correctly as the default encoding is typically UTF-8.

```bash
pip-compile requirements.in > requirements.txt
```

Following this process guarantees that the `requirements.txt` file is consistent and compatible with our production Docker build environment.
