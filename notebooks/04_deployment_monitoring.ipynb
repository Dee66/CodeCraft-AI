    "ðŸŸ© **GOOD:** This notebook demonstrates production-grade deployment and monitoring patterns for CodeCraft AI, following Clean Architecture and AWS-native best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Purpose\n",
    "- Show how to deploy AI services using AWS-native tools (SageMaker, Lambda, ECS, etc.)\n",
    "- Demonstrate monitoring, logging, and alerting for operational excellence\n",
    "- Provide reproducible, testable deployment and monitoring workflows for stakeholders and technical reviewers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "- AWS account with permissions for SageMaker, Lambda, CloudWatch, and related services\n",
    "- All secrets and config must be injected via environment variables or AWS Secrets Manager/SSM (never hardcoded)\n",
    "- This notebook is a client only; all deployment and monitoring logic is handled by AWS-native services\n",
    "\n",
    "> ðŸŸ¦ **NOTE:** For local dev, you can simulate deployment steps, but production deployments must use AWS-native CI/CD and monitoring tools."
