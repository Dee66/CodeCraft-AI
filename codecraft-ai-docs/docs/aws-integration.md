# AWS Integration in CodeCraft AI

## Overview

The CodeCraft AI project leverages various AWS services to enhance its capabilities and ensure a robust, scalable architecture. This document outlines the specific AWS services integrated into the project and their respective roles.

## Key AWS Services Used

### 1. Amazon SageMaker

Amazon SageMaker is utilized for building, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale. It provides a fully managed environment that simplifies the machine learning workflow, allowing for rapid experimentation and iteration.

### 2. AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is employed for serverless computing, enabling the execution of code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers. This service is ideal for running lightweight functions that process data or trigger workflows within the CodeCraft AI pipeline.

### 3. Amazon S3

Amazon S3 serves as the primary storage solution for the project, providing durable and scalable object storage for datasets, model artifacts, and logs. It ensures that all data is securely stored and easily accessible for processing and analysis.

### 4. Amazon API Gateway

Amazon API Gateway is used to create, publish, and manage APIs for the CodeCraft AI project. It acts as a front door for applications to access backend services, enabling seamless integration with various components of the architecture.

### 5. AWS Step Functions

AWS Step Functions orchestrate the workflow of the CodeCraft AI pipeline, allowing for the coordination of multiple AWS services into serverless workflows. This service enhances the reliability and scalability of the application by managing the execution of tasks and handling errors gracefully.

## Integration Architecture

The integration of these AWS services forms a cohesive architecture that supports the various functionalities of CodeCraft AI. The following diagram illustrates the interactions between the services:
