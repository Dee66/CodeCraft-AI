            <h2>Welcome to CodeCraft AI</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>CodeCraft AI</strong> is a fully custom, end-to-end AI platform, meticulously architected, engineered, and deployed to production (also dev & staging) on AWS.
              This is no theoretical exercise or boilerplate demo. This is a living testament to architecting and deploying truly custom AI solutions that are not just functional, but uncompromisingly robust, intrinsically secure, infinitely scalable, and operationally mature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experience the mastery of a full-stack, cloud-native AI implementation: from automated password rotation and Dockerized services to a hardened CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) rigorously validating code and deploying across a rich AWS ecosystem‚Äîincluding S3, ALB, Secrets Manager, IAM, IaC (CDK), ECR, ECS, and Fargate.
              CodeCraft AI showcases the rigorous engineering principles vital for transforming groundbreaking AI into tangible, battle-ready business impact. This is how I turn vision into a deployable reality.

            <h2>üöÄ Why CodeCraft AI?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Enterprise-Grade, Not a Toy:</strong><br />
                CodeCraft AI is a real, production-hardened platform‚Äîbattle-tested in live AWS environments, not a classroom exercise or a copy-paste demo. Every feature is engineered for real-world reliability, scale, and business impact.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>AWS-Native, Cloud-First Engineering:</strong><br />
                The architecture is deeply integrated with AWS best practices, leveraging the full spectrum of cloud-native services‚ÄîS3, ECS on Fargate, ALB, SageMaker, ECR, IAM, Secrets Manager, SSM Parameter Store, and more. Infrastructure is defined as code (CDK, Python) for repeatable, auditable, and secure deployments.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Business Value at the Core:</strong><br />
                Every technical decision is mapped directly to measurable business outcomes‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs reducing operational overhead, accelerating delivery, or enabling new revenue streams. This is AI with a purpose, not just AI for its own sake.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Operational Excellence, Proven in Production:</strong><br />
                Zero-downtime hot-reloads, atomic model and data updates, automated rollbacks, and cost-optimized, serverless infrastructure. The platform is designed for continuous delivery, rapid iteration, and operational resilience‚Äîno manual interventions, no surprises.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Security as a Foundation, Not an Afterthought:</strong><br />
                End-to-end security is woven into every layer: OIDC-based passwordless deployments, least-privilege IAM, automated secret rotation, private networking, and rigorous compliance with the AWS Well-Architected Framework. Secrets and configs are never hardcoded‚Äîalways managed via AWS Secrets Manager and SSM.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Relentless Focus on Automation and Quality:</strong><br />
                From multi-stage Docker builds and automated CI/CD (GitHub Actions) to proactive vulnerability scanning, code linting (Ruff), and pre-commit hooks, every step is automated for consistency, security, and speed.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transparent, Developer-First Experience:</strong><br />
                Centralized logging (CloudWatch), real-time dashboards, and Docusaurus-powered documentation ensure that every aspect of the system is observable, explainable, and easy to onboard for new engineers.
              </li>
            </ul>
